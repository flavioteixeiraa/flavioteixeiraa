👋 Hi, I’m @flavioteixeiraa
👀 I’m interested in QA automation, including tools like Cypress, Selenium, and TestCafe. I'm passionate about ensuring software quality and building robust testing frameworks.
🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced testing methodologies, continuous integration (CI), and continuous deployment (CD) practices. I'm also exploring how to integrate testing more effectively into DevOps pipelines.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on enhancing test automation frameworks, developing comprehensive test strategies, and improving software testing processes. I’m especially interested in open-source projects and community-driven initiatives.
📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at [your.email@example.com] or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/flavio-teixeira-4475021a1.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I love experimenting with new technologies and once built a custom test automation tool from scratch just to challenge myself and learn more about software development.
